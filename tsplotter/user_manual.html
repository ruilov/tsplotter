        <b>tsplotter</b> is a tool that allows intuitive and interactive manipulation of data. If you'd like to jump right in, see the <a href="#examples">examples</a> section.
        <br><br>
        Some data sources require the following Chrome extension: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en">CORS Unblock</a>
        <br><br>
        Please email me at <a href="mailto:ruilov@gmail.com">ruilov@gmail.com</a> for questions or comments. Testing and support done primarily in Mac + Chrome.
        <br><br>
        <b>tsplotter</b> includes:
        <ul>
          <li>connectivity to external <a href="#quandl">databases</a>, with a lot of historical data: stocks, interest rates, commodities, financials, economic.
          <li>a simple <a href="#send">publishing mechanism</a> for your plots.</li>
          <li>a concise python API.</li>
          <li>built-in <a href="#functions">quantitative features</a>: correlation, volatility, trends, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        In <b>tsplotter</b> you write formulas like in a spreadhseet, but your formulas manipule entire data series at once. Examples of formulas: <code>series*2</code> or <code>(series1+series2)/2</code>, and you see results on the screen right away.
      
        <br><br>
        <h1><center id="data">Data</center></h1>
        There's a few methods to get data into <b>tsplotter</b>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://data.nasdaq.com/">Quandl</a>: a website that offers a large amount of free and paid data. The search box in <b>tsplotter</b> searches for data in quandl. Quandl is organized into databases. Each database has multiple symbols, each symbol has multiple series. To use quandl data in <b>tsplotter</b>, use the following syntax:
          <center><pre>DATABASE|SYMBOL["series"]</pre></center>

          <li><b>STOCK</b>: for stock prices, <b>tsplotter</b> uses <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/">Alpha Vantage</a>. An example symbol would be STOCK|SPY, this will plot the "adjusted close" series. Other series available are: open, high, low, close, adjusted close, volume, dividend amount, split coefficient.

          <li><b>CME and ICE</b>: example symbols are CME|NYM_CL_Z2024 or ICE|ICEF_SF3_U2024.

          <li><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/">FRED</a>:  example symbol FRED|UNRATE.

          <li><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/api#explore-api/">Crypto</a>: database of crypto prices. A full list of coins is available <a href="https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/list">here</a> (use the 'id' field), but you can get all the usual ones easily with CRYPTO|bitcoin, CRYPTO|ethereum, CRYPTO|ripple, CRYPTO|dogecoin, etc

          <li><b>Copy-paste</b>: you can simply copy-paste data from excel with ctrl-v. The data has to be formatted as columns, where the first column holds the dates and the first row holds the headers. The headers determine the name of each series in <b>tsplotter</b></li>
        </ul>
      <br>

      <h1><center id="commands">Commands</center></h1>
      
      <ul>
        <li><b>Plot</b>: F9. Evaluates and plots your formulas.</li>
        <li><b>Copy data</b>: CTRL-ALT-C. Replots and copies the results to the clipboard.</li>
        <li><b>Turn off a formula</b>: CTRL+B. The formula won't be evaluated at all.</li>
        <li><b>Hide a formula</b>: CTRL+H. The formula will still be evaluated, but not shown. Useful for formulas that define new symbols.</li>
        <li><b>Toggle secondary axis for a formula</b>: CTRL+T.</li>
        <li><b>Clear colors</b>: CTRL-ALT-V. New colors will be assigned on a new F9.</li>
        <li><b>Manually color a formula</b>: use the color wheel.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <h1><center id="send">Distribute</center></h1>
      To send your plot to someone else press the "Copy Link" button at the top of the page. This link is public and can be accessed by anyone else.
      <br><br>
      However this method only works if your plot does not have any data that it received via copy-paste or the Python API. In those cases, save the plot to a file, and you'll be able to load it later into <b>tsplotter</b>.
      <br><br>
      There's a python script called Server.py. If you're running that script, you'll be prompted for a location when you save a plot, otherwise the file downloads to your browser download directory. This is the only benefit of running the server at the moment.

      <h1><center id="functions">Functions</center></h1>

      <ul>
        <li>the usual arithmetic operators <code>+, -, *, /, ^</code> are used for adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, exponentiating a series by another, or by a number. Only x coordinates that appear in both series are used.</li>

        <li>Create your own  symbols using <code>=</code>. Those symbols can be used in latter formulas in the same plot. For example: <code>a = WIKI|AAPL + 1</code>.</li>

        <li>a number represents a series of constant value (with every x coordinate).</li>

        <li><code>abs(series)</code>: takes the absolute value of each coordinate.</li>

        <li><code>lag(series,lag=number|optional)</code>: lags the series by the specified number of coordinates, that is, it shifts values to the right if lag > 0, and to the left if lag < 0. Default lag = 1. Useful for, for example, computing changes. Example: <code>a-lag(a)</code></li>

        <li><code>subsample(series,frequency)</code>: samples 1 point in every "frequency" points, starting with the first. Useful for calculating, for example, weekly returns: <code>subsample(r(a,5),5)</code></li>

        <li><code>daily()</code>: makes a daily series of value 1. You can also just use the value 1 or any other number.

        <li><code>interpolate(series1, series2)</code>: returns a series with the same dates as series2, and values taken from series1, using linear interpolation (and extrapolation) to fill in the blanks.</li>

        <li><code>greater(series or number, series or number)</code>: takes the max of the value in each series, keeping only the common dates.</li>

        <li><code>lesser(series or number, series or number)</code>: takes the min of the value in each series, keeping only the common dates.</li>

        <li><code>sup(series)</code>: takes the cummulative maximum of the series.</li>

        <li><code>inf(series)</code>: takes the cummulative minimum of the series</li>

        <li><code>log(series,base=number|optional)</code>: takes the log of each value in the series. base = e by default.</li>

        <li><code>ind(series)</code>: divides every value in the series by its first value. Useful for plotting multiple series in the same axis.</li>

        <li><code>last(series)</code> or <code>first(series)</code>: sets every value in the series to its last / first value.</li>

        <li><code>std(series,window=number|optional)</code>: std dev of the last 'window' points of the series (looking back), or cummulative if no window provided.</li>

        <li><code>avg(series,window=number|optional)</code>: average of the last 'window' points of the series (looking back), or cummulative if no window provided.</li>

        <li><code>yearlyAvg(series)</code>: returns a series with the same dates and the values replaced with the averages of each calendar year.</li>

        <li><code>monthlyAvg(series)</code>: returns a series with the same dates and the values replaced with the averages of each calendar month.</li>

        <li><code>cum(series,window=number|optional)</code>: sum of the last 'window' points of the series (looking back), or cummulative if no window provided.</li>

        <li><code>prod(series,window=number|optional)</code>: product of the last 'window' points of the series (looking back), or cummulative if no window provided.</li>

        <li><code>d(series,window=number|optional)</code>: difference between first and last points in a window (looking back). window default = 1. Equivalent to series - lag(series,window).</li>

        <li><code>r(series,window=number|optional)</code>: ratio between first and last points in a window (looking back). window default = 1. Equivalent to series / lag(series,window)</li>

        <li><code>vol(series,window=number|optional)</code>: volatility of the series, defined as std dev of returns from one point to the next, over the window (looking back), or cummulative if no window provided.</li>

        <li><code>corr(series1,series2,window=number|optional,function=string|optional)</code>: correlation of the return from one point of the series to the next, over the window (looking back), or cummulative if no window provided. Only x values that appear in both series are returned. The returns calculation is done on the remaining points. A different returns function can be passed in and should use 'x' to stand for the series. The default function is "x". "r(x)", "log(r(x))" and "d(x)" are some possible alternatives.</li>

        <li><code>beta(series1,series2,window=number|optional,function=string|optional)</code>: calculates the regression slope of series2 with respect to series1. The arguments work similarly to the corr function.</li>

        <li><code>trend(series)</code>: calculates the linear trend of the series.</li>

        <li><code>if(condition,series1 or number1,series2 or number2)</code>: condition is a series that can be defined by comparing two other series (or numbers) with the symbols == (equals), < or >. For each date that appears in all series, when the conditional is true take the value of series1, otherwise take the value of series2.</li>

        <li><code>zap(condition,series)</code>: throw away values of series for which the condition is true.</li>

        <li><code>keep(condition,series)</code>: keeps values of series for which the condition is true.</li>

        <li><code>union(series1,series2)</code>: joins the two series, keeping the value of series1 where they intersect.</li>

        <li><code>dx(series,window=number|optional)</code>: returns the diference in the x-coordinates between one point and the next. The values of the series are not used.</li>

        <li><code>bounds(series,string1|number1,string2|number2)</code>: restricts the series to the x coordinates >= string1|number1 and <= string2|number2. Example bounds: 10.5, "10.5", 2016-01-01".</li>

        <li><code>strip(string,string,number)</code>: calculates the strip of a commodity. The arguments are: root symbol, start month, number of months. For example: strip("CME|CL","F2020",3) will calculate (CME|CLF2020 + CME|CLG2020 + CME|CLH2020)/3. Please note that because this function will load many symbols at once, the number of months should be kept to 12 at most.</li>

        <li><code>nrby_strip(string,number,number)</code>: similarly to 'strip', calculates the strip of a commodity. However the symbols used here are continuous futures symbols. For example: strip("CHRIS|CME_CL",2,3) will calculate (CHRIS|CME_CL2 + CHRIS|CME_CL3 + CHRIS|CME_CL4)/3. Please note that because this function will load many symbols at once, the number of months should be kept to 12 at most.</li>
